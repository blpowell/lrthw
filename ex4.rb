#Exercise 4: Variables & Names

#Vars
age = 30
name = "Ben"
food = "cake"
long_variable_name = "underscore"

#Output
puts "Hi there, I'm #{name}"
puts "I quite like this syntax. It means I can put my age (#{age}) in a sentence"
puts "Time for some well earned #{food}!"
puts "Not a fan of the #{long_variable_name} style though :/"
